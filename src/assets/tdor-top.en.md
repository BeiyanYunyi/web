**As the first month of spring passes its halfway mark, March 31 marks another Transgender Day of Visibility.**

Throughout this winter, we've faced too much sorrow, losing many cherished friends. Yet many of us persist in living; new connections are formed, warmth and companionship gradually spread. New hope, vitality, life, are sprouting.

As advocates in the transgender/queer movement, we deeply understand: every simple act of "visibility" from each companion will help future generations navigate through the fog, to recognize their own brightness, bringing hope and strength. So, this spring, One Among Us is collecting letters with "visibility" as the theme: a poem, a story, or simply some uplifting wordsâ€”all are welcome.

We'll read some of the letters selected in our 'TDOV 2024 Night' livestream around March 31.

**Note: The deadline for letters is March 27 23:59 (China Standard Time); March 27 16:00 (UTC).** As the Night will livestream on Chinese domestic platforms, please be mindful of sociopolitical risks when writing your letter. One Among Us reserves the right to lightly edit the letters received, to ensure smooth broadcasting of the Night.
