**As the first month of spring passes its halfway mark, March 31st marks another Transgender Visibility Day.**

Throughout this winter, we've faced too much sorrow, losing many cherished friends. Yet many of us persist in living; new connections are formed, warmth and companionship gradually spread. New hope, vitality, life, are sprouting.

As advocates in the transgender/queer movement, we deeply understand: every simple act of "visibility" from each companion will help future generations navigate through the fog, to recognize their own brightness, bringing hope and strength. So, this spring, One Among Us is collecting letters with "visibility" as the theme: a poem, a story, or simply aome uplifting words, any text is welcome.

We'll select letters to be read at the '2024 Transgender Visibility Day Night,' on live around March 31st.

**Note: the deadline for letters is March 28th 0:00 (Beijing); March 27th 16:00 (GMT).** As the Night will be broadcasted on Chinese domestic platforms, please be mindful of sociopolitical risks when writing your letter. One Among Us reserves the right to lightly edit the letters received, to ensure smooth broadcasting of the Night.
