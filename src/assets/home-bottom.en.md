# Reject the Violence to Transgender

The [brochure](https://www.unfe.org/zh-hans/learn-more/) from the UN Human Rights Office states that â€œtransgender people are at very high risk of violence, harassment and discrimination around the world Violations of their human rights include bullying and verbal abuse, denial of health care, education, job opportunities and housing, criminalization, arbitrary arrest and detention, violence, assault, torture, rape and murder. Other factors such as occupation, socioeconomic class, and disability status can compound the violence and discrimination they face."  

In addition to calling for a better social environment, there are many things that we can do:  
- Grasp and understand about the experiences, issues and concerns of transgender people.  
- Address the person by a concept, personal pronoun, gender, and name of their choice.  
- Say no to any form of stigmatize, discrimination, or violence against transgender people.
