I always remember a sentence in "Coco": Death is not the end of life, but oblivion is. Those who have left us may be saying to us somewhere, "Please don't forget me."    

Existing traces may slowly be erased with time. Old photos will fade, and social accounts that haven't been logged in for a while may be deleted. However, it is not always those things that actually exist that cause waves. Suddenly, at a certain moment, I remembered the topics we talked about and the places we visited together, and the gate of memory opened, and the voice and smile were still there.  

Many of us did not meet each other because of geographical or business ties, but because of our common living conditions, we came to such a place called "community". Maybe I have never met in reality, maybe they are far apart, crossed the boundaries of language and nationality, maybe... I even can't confirm the person I am chatting with, the "real existence" of them. But which one is true and which one is false? Even if we are not their family members, friends, or lovers in reality, can that friendship or even family affection be easily denied? When they pass away, when that avatar will never be online again, I always have a selfish desire to find a place to make some real commemorations for them, so that they can continue to exist and accompany us all the way.  

That's why the website exists. Those who left our lives prematurely due to various reasons, those transgender people and our cisgender partners (allies), are still one of us (one among us), silently taking care of, accompanying us, empowering us, and delivering our courage to continue living. Maybe the name written on the monument in reality is not the name they like, and it may not reflect their true identity, but we can still realize all this in our own memorial.  

We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.
