I always remember a sentence in "Coco": Death is not the end of life, but oblivion is. Those who have left us, perhaps somewhere, are whispering to us: "Please don't forget me."    

The traces of existece may fade with time. Old photos can lose their color, and social media accounts may disappear as internet change. Yet, the things that influences us, that brings them back to us, are not always those that physically exist. When we suddenly recall conversations we had or places we've been, the gates of memory swing open, and their voices and smiles are as vivid as ever.  

Many of us did not meet because of geographical or professional ties, but because of our shared circumstances in life, we've come to this place we call "community". We may have never met in person, may live far apart, crossing the boundaries of language and nationality. Perhaps I can't even verify their "real existence". But which one is true and which one is false? Even if we are not their family members, friends, or lovers in reality, can that friendship or even family affection be easily denied? When they pass away, when that avatar will never be online again, I always have a selfish desire to find a place to make some real commemorations for them, so that they can continue to exist and accompany us all the way.  

That's why the website exists. Those who left our lives prematurely due to various reasons, those transgender people and our cisgender partners (allies), are still one of us (one among us), silently taking care of, accompanying us, empowering us, and delivering our courage to continue living. Maybe the name written on the monument in reality is not the name they like, and it may not reflect their true identity, but we can still realize all this in our own memorial.  

We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.
